# Module_5_Challenge

This repo is for the week 5 challenge about Matplotlib and statistics plotting using pandas and scipy.

For this assignment, I use the original starter_code provided jupyter notebook as template for completing the whole work. The steps involves loading modules, reading datafiles and combine. plotting charts by plot and using pandas pyplot. Calculate summary statistics and pearson correlation. Finaly perform the linear regression in the scatter plot with analysis report.
